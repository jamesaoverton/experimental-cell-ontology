# Experimental Cell Ontology

This repository contains an **experimental** version of the Cell Ontology with species-specific cell types. It is for *development only*.

Tables in the `ontology/` directory are imported from our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ja1IYLWygg3k-beGPRg_uza_8-FPBLzF90WbHkbCi4Q/edit#gid=0). See the [Makefile](Makefile) for build information.
