# Experimental Cell Ontology

This repository contains an **experimental** version of the Cell Ontology with species-specific cell types. It is for *development only*.

Tables in the `ontology/` directory are imported from our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWWyvZorh3vR_BocJh3pzWe4EcYB2HPai2MWckvDJ-A/edit?usp=sharing). See the [Makefile](Makefile) for build information.
